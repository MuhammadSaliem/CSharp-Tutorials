/*
The main four pillars of OOP: 
    Inheritance
    encapsulation
    Abstraction
    polymorphism

Inheritance: is a feature of oop which simply allows of the creation of 
 a new class of existing class by inheriting its atributes and behaviors.

base class: Iherited from
derived class: inheriting from it

class: You can create objects from
interface: Is similar to abstract class but without methods implementions
    but it's cpu frindly

virtual: virtual keyword means when you inherit from the class you can override that method

Polymoriphism: is the ability of an object to take many forms 
    There are many types of polymorphims

statis polymorphism = method overloading
dynamic polymorphis = method overriding
